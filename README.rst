Herein lies slides for various talks about JavaScript testing
and CI w/ `jstestnet`_ and `Qunit`_.  This is probably not very helpful as
documentation but you can find loads more info on the
aforementioned sites.

If you're still here then here's how to build the slides from their
`reStructuredText`_ sources::

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python build.py somefile.txt
